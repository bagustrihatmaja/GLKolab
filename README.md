== GLKolab ==

This is a final project for my Computer Graphic class as an undergraduate student of Computer Science in Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, Surabaya, Indonesia. 

GLKolab is OpenGL Based 2D Whiteboard Collaboration. This is socket server-client based program which one server serve as an host for an whiteboard for its client. Very simple but it slighty usefull although I would not use this //piece of crap// for my entire life.

Basic feature :
  * Primitive Object (Line, Arc, Rectangle, Circle)
  * Text
  * Network Support (You don't say?)
  * Eraser
  * Object editing
